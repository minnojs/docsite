This page will cover the minimum requirements to install the Minnosuite Dashboard.

### Common Requirements

For all installs you need a computer, with a recomended 2 GB of disc space free.  

If you want people to be able to connect to it from the internet, you will need to be able to listen to port 80 on the computer, which may require administrator access, and have port 80 open to the world and not blocked by your firewall.  If you want people to be able to connect securely to your machine, you will need the same for port 443 also.  Additionally, you should have a static IP address on the machine. 

You will probably also want to have a domain for your server.  We have a guide for setting up one with Freenom [here](../domain).  Or you may already have a domain for your machine, or be able to have your IT department set up a domain for you.
