## Setting up your domain
1.  Go to http://www.freenom.com/ 
2.  Go to Services -> Register a new domain.
3.  Pick the domain you want and register it (You will register to freenom in the process of obtaining the domain).
4.  Click "manage domain" on the domain you registered
5.  Click on "manage freenom DNS"
6.  Add a record for your site.  Set the name as the domain name that you registered, the target as your static IP address, and the type as "A" if your IP address is IPv4 (like 123.11.22.33, or "AAAA" if your IP address is IPv6 (like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).  Then click "save changes".  Note that it may take 1-2 hours for the changes to go live, so you will need to wait at this point.
