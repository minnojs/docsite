Project Implicit is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and international collaborative network of researchers investigating group-based bias and disparities such as those based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.

The mission of Project Implicit is to educate the public about bias and to provide a “virtual laboratory” for collecting data on the internet. Project Implicit scientists produce high-impact research that forms the basis of our scientific knowledge about bias and disparity.
