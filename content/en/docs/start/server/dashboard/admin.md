As an admin, we recommend that you first make sure the Dashboard works over https (i.e., provides secure connection to all the users). 
Please refer to the relevant help page in this website to learn how to do that. 

Next, create user accounts for the researchers who will use the system. 
Even if you are the only user of your system, it is better if you separate between the admin account and the researcher account. 
To create a new user account, go to Admin->User Management and Add a new user. 


If you want the Dashboard to send emails to users (e.g., when creating new accounts, or when one user adds another user as a collaborator on a study), 
go to Admin->Edit Configuration and Enable Gmail. 
Because the Dashboard needs the email password for sending emails, we recommend you create a new Gmail account for the Dashboard.
