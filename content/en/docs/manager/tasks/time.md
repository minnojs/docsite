title: Time
description: Almost any time-sensitive task you can imagine
---

The time task activates a [minno-time]({{< relref "docs/time" >}}) task.
These are tasks focused on time-sensitive activities.
You will probably load the task from a file (use `scriptUrl`).
Note that it is almost always imperative to use the `name` property, as it is used to refer to
data gathered by the task, and to identify it in the results.

```js
{ type: 'time', name: 'my-task`, scriptUrl: 'my-task.js' }
```

The API is as follows:

property        | description
--------------- | ---------------------
scriptUrl       | (String) The url of the file describing your time task.
script          | (Object) The full task object (as generated by the timeAPI constructor)
