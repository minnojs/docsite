### Education

Here are some presentations good for introducing the essentials of the PI system:

* A lab presentation about integrating miManager with Project implicit, including comparison to `expt` files: [presentation](http://slides.com/andydzik/deck), [sample study](https://dw2.psyc.virginia.edu/implicit/showfiles.jsp?user=andy&study=sample/pimanager).
* A [presentation](http://eladzlot.github.io/pi-presentations/basics.html) focused on various features of the sequencer.

### Extensions

The PI tasks are easily extensible.

[Yoav Bar-Anan](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~baranany/) from [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html)
has created several extensions for the easy creation of a few common reaction-time tasks. 
You can find the instructions for using them right [here](https://git.io/JvE5H).
