title: Info
description: >
    The info question isn't strictly a question.
    It allows you to use the common question properties in order to display information to the users. 
---

For example the following question will simply display the description without offering any additional user interface (explicit question).

```javascript
{
	type: 'info',
	description: '<p>The following questions deal with emotions</p>' +
		'<p>Please answer them as honestly as possible</p>'
}
```
