Sometimes it is not enough to hard code behaviors into your tasks, 
sometimes you want behavior to depend on a previous response,
or change some texts according to randomization.
In order to achieve these behaviors you can use variables.

We will first describe variables that are common across all tasks, and are always available - these are the `global` and `current` variables.
Then we will get down to variables variables that are available only in specific contexts - such as the `data` and `meta` variables.

### Accessing variables
There are many ways to use variables within the PI tasks.
You can learn about them in their respective documentation, check out [conditions](mixer.html#conditions) and [templates](templates.html).
In addition, some of the variables can be accessed directly from your JavaScript, in cases that this is possible it will be mentioned in the description of the variable.
