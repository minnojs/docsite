      <description>By default, each time users attempt to leave the page, minno-manager inquires whether they actually mean it. The allowLeave task cancels this inquiry, and allows easily leaving the player.. It is usefull if you want to allow users to browse away from a page, for example toward the end of a task in a debriefing page. It makes debugging a bit easier as well.
The API is as follows:
   property description     preventLeaving Whether to prevent users from leaving the page (default is false).</description>

      <description>The injectStyle task allows you to change the style of Minno throught a study. The style of web pages is determined by their CSS. injectStyle allows you to add any CSS that you like into your study.
{ type:&amp;#39;injectStyle&amp;#39;, css: &amp;#39;[piq-page] .page-buttons .page-submit {background-color:#d9534f; border:#d43f3a}&amp;#39; } If you have a lot of CSS that you want to add, it makes sense to break the string down as follows:
{ type:&amp;#39;injectStyle&amp;#39;, css: [ &amp;#39;[piq-page] .</description>

      <title>Is Touch</title>

      <description>Detecting when users are using a touch interface on the way is notoriously difficult. It is reasonably easy to detect touch features (such as the existance of a touch screen), but many devices allow the use of both a touch screen and a keyboard and the player can not know which of these the user prefers to use.
isTouch is a task that allows you to identify users that are using touch interfaces.</description>

      <description>The message tasks are built to be as simple as possible, all they do is present simple html templates. In order to load a template simply set it into the template property as a string, or set the appropriate URL into templateUrl. That&amp;rsquo;s it. (This is not relevant for most users, but the templates are rendered using angularjs $compile and therefore all the relevant directives are available).
The context for the template has the following variables available: {global, current, task}.</description>

      <description>The postCsv task is responsible for posting CSV data to the server. It is a good way to save data in a simple easy to use format. In fact, you can use this simple server in order to save it.
In order to use the postCsv task, you should set up csv logging in the task settings:
API.addSettings(&amp;#39;logger&amp;#39;, {type:&amp;#39;csv&amp;#39;, url:&amp;#39;csv.php&amp;#39;}); Then, whenever you want in your task you can send the data using the postCsv task.</description>

      <description>The quest task activates a minno-quest task. These are tasks allow you to create complex questionnaires for your experiments. You will probably load the task from a file (use scriptUrl). Note that it is almost always imperative to use the name property, as it is used to refer to data gathered by the task, and to identify it in the results.
{ type: &amp;#39;quest&amp;#39;, name: &amp;#39;my-quest`, scriptUrl: &amp;#39;my-quest.js&amp;#39; } The API is as follows:</description>

API    property description     variableName The name of the variable to which the value is set within the global object. For assigning variables nested within global, use the following format: iat.feedback would assign the value to the variable feedback under global.</description>

      <description>The time task activates a minno-time task. These are tasks focused on time-sensitive activities. You will probably load the task from a file (use scriptUrl). Note that it is almost always imperative to use the name property, as it is used to refer to data gathered by the task, and to identify it in the results.
{ type: &amp;#39;time&amp;#39;, name: &amp;#39;my-task`, scriptUrl: &amp;#39;my-task.js&amp;#39; } The API is as follows:

A typical yesNo task may look like this:
{ type:&amp;#39;yesNo&amp;#39;, heading: &amp;#39;Task length&amp;#39;, text: &amp;#39;Would you like to participate in the long task (15min), or in the short one (5min)&amp;#39;, yesText: &amp;#39;The long one&amp;#39;, noText: &amp;#39;The short one&amp;#39;, path: &amp;#39;longOrShort&amp;#39; } After completing the task, the global property longOrShort will be set with true or false according to the response of the user.</description>
